        <h2>A Little Info About Me</h2>
        <p>You all may know me as GlitchedCode, but my real name is Justin. I grew up in Denmark for the first three months of my life and my parents decided to move to the United States of America. I am 15 years old, and I currently live in Greenville, South Carolina. I am in the 10th grade and I've always wanted to be some type of programmer. I really don't want to be too specific since a lot of programming languages go into different, specific things. I've always thought about what goes into making a program, and I was fascinated with what I found. I got into Minecraft from my cousin, Cody. I bought an account and loved playing around with the mechanics like redstone. I then found out about mods and what magnificent things you can do with them. I tried searching up how to make mods and eventually came accross <a id="external" href="https://bukkit.org/">Bukkit</a>, a recreation of Minecraft, just modded so you can mess with what happens and what doesn't happen in the game. I knew nothing about Java when I discovered Bukkit and went in it without knowing anything. I searched up a few tutorials and started learning some stuff I didn't know. Of course, this was definitely not the way to go if I wanted to be an expert at Java. Last year I probably couldn't even explain what syntax is. I began to buy books, download apps, go through step-by-step tutorials of learning Java, so I could increase my knowledge of the amazing language. I met an amazing person called bwfcwalshy, an ex-moderator on Bukkit. We became friends over the summer and we even tried to found a gaming company called GalvabyteGames. Of course, this didn't last long since after the summer we had school responsibilities to do. Our communication with eachother slowly faded away. After that I started playing on <a id="external" href="http://hivemc.com">The Hive</a>, a lovely mini-game server. I eventually met some of my best friends, including iGoochy, wakasocks, BlueEyedPanda, and more. I then got the courage to apply for moderator on the Hive. A few weeks later I got a friend invite from BillWarlow, the Staff Manager of Hive. I was <i>very</i> happy, yet nervous at the same time. I made a few mistakes here and there while being mod, but I have learned from those mistakes, and will hopefully be a better mod in the future. As of now, this Monday (April 11, 2016) will be my 6-month anniversary of being mod on Hive. I have gotten to know a lot of people and became friends with the entire staff team (even if I get roasted). No matter what I will always love the people I have come to know at Hive, and have had an amazing experience. Sadly, I have seen a lot of people I know and cherish come and go. Time is the one thing we can't get back, so I'm glad I'm spending it with people that love and care about me. Everyone on the staff team and people that I met make me who I am today, and I am proud of who I am.</p>
        <h2>What I've Made</h2>
        <p>Most of my plugins are for small private servers, or I am just making them to learn, or have fun. However, one of my bigger projects, Eden (which is very outdated and poorly made), can be found <a id="external" href="https://github.com/glitchedcoder/Eden">here</a>. This project was abandoned a while ago, so no promises it'll work or function correctly. You may download and edit the project if you feel compelled to do so. I am still making plugins today, just not as frequent since I have other hobbies (like this website) that I would like to work on.</p>
