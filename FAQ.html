        <h2>What Is Complimenting</h2>
        <p>On here, complimenting is writing something nice about a person you appreciate for what they do. It can be anyone, as long as they have a Minecraft username to go by.</p>
        <h2>Where Can I Compliment</h2>
        <p>You can compliment someone by going <a id="external" href="http://goo.gl/forms/Sk7sz7L2KQ">here</a>!</p>
        <h2>My Compliment Isn't Showing Up</h2>
        <p>I usually get 5-10 submissions of compliments a day (as of now), and most submissions have more than one compliment attatched to them; so depending on all of these factors, and the fact that I have school 75% of the day (not including weekends), it may take some time for me to update compliments. The only other reason a compliment was not posted is because the compliment was not suitable for public view (this includes inappropriate language, threats, or anything explicit), or it wasn't a real compliment. What makes a compliment a compliment is the fact that the user that is submitting the compliment is listing at least one thing they like or admire of the user they are complimenting.</p>
        <h2>I've Changed My Minecraft Username</h2>
        <p>Currently, there isn't an <b>official</b> way to change your page name and compliment username, since this is a rare occurance. However, with the growing "population" of users, this could become a regular occurance. If you do happen to change your username, please contact me at <a id="external" href="mailto: support@glitchedcode.me">support@glitchedcode.me</a>. Make sure to include your previous username, UUID, your new username, and proof that you own the account. This can be as simple as a screenshot of you signed in on the Minecraft program. Sometime in the near future I will probably have it so you can just submit another form, but for now this is what I have. Sorry for any inconvenience this brings.</p>
        <h2>What Do I Get When I Donate</h2>
        <p>Currently, there aren't that many things I can give for donating. If you'd like to like to suggest some ideas go ahead and send an e-mail to <a id="external" href="mailto: support@glitchedcode.me">support@glitchedcode.me</a>.</p>
        <h2>Are There Any Rules</h2>
        <p>There will be an official rules page soon, but for now you can go off of these:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Don't submit anything you wouldn't on a public website.</li><br/>
            <li>Don't abuse the form and submit a lot of submissions in a short time.</li><br/>
            <li>Don't submit anything explicit. This includes inappropriate language (discluding words like, "ass" and "damn") and NSFW content.</li><br/>
        </ul>
