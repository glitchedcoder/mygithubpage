        <h2>My Compliment Isn't Showing Up</h2>
        <p>I usually get 5-10 submissions of compliments a day (as of now), and most submissions have more than one compliment attatched to them; so depending on all of these factors, and the fact that I have school 75% of the day (not including weekends), it may take some time for me to update compliments. The only other reason a compliment was not posted is because the compliment was not suitable for public view (this includes inappropriate language, threats, or anything explicit), or it wasn't a real compliment. What makes a compliment a compliment is the fact that the user that is submitting the compliment is at least listing one thing they like or admire of the user they are complimenting.</p>
        <h2>I've Changed My Minecraft Username</h2>
        <p>Currently, there isn't an <b>official</b> way to change your page name and compliment username, since this is a rare occurance. However, with the growing "population" of users, this could become a regular occurance. If you do happen to change your username, please contact me at <a id="external" href="mailto: support@glitchedcode.me">support@glitchedcode.me</a>. Make sure to include your previous username, UUID, your new username, and proof that you own the account. This can be as simple as a screenshot of you signed in on the Minecraft program. Sometime in the near future I will probably have it so you can just submit another form, but for now this is what I have. Sorry for any inconvenience this brings.</p>
