        <h2>My Compliment Isn't Showing Up</h2>
        <p>I usually get 5-10 submissions of compliments a day (as of now), and most submissions have more than one compliment attatched to them; so depending on all of these factors, and the fact that I have school 75% of the day (not including weekends), it may take some time for me to update compliments. The only other reason a compliment was not posted is because the compliment was not suitable for public view (this includes inappropriate language, threats, or anything explicit), or it wasn't a real compliment. What makes a compliment a compliment is the fact that the user that is submitting the compliment is at least listing one thing they like or admire of the user they are complimenting.</p>
