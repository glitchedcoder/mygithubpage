        <h2>Welcome to my website!</h2>
        <p>This is my new website, thanks to <a id="external" href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>. This website was coded by me, GlitchedCode, and I'm very happy with how it looks, even though it's pretty basic.</p>
        <h2>For Gunnar (iGoochy):</h2>
        <p>Some times, things may not go your way, people could be rude, or just things in general can put you down. Here are some things that will cheer you up in these hard times. Below, we answered the question, "What's one thing you like about Gunnar?". Thanks for bee-ing awesome. :bee:</p>
        <quote>"Well, there's so many things, really. He's just such a generous and humorous person, and that's usually why I ask him so many times for him to start a call, because when he's there, I have a good time, no matter what we actually do while calling, whether it's slaying people in SkyWars or on some stupid game on Hypickle. He has a great and welcoming personality, and usually is very fair with new people. He sticks up for his friends whenever people (me) talks about people they don't like. I especially like it when he rages, always cracks me up. In summary, he's a great a loving guy that can always cheer you up, make you laugh, etc." - <b>GlitchedCode</b></quote>
        <quote>"His humor. Like it's stupid but funny; Quality banter" - <b>Ana</b></quote>

        <quote>"(Gonna start and this sounds cheesy asf lmao) - He's always happy and in the time i've known him he's cheered me up so many times without knowing it xD also the fact that when he's raging it's the funniest thing ever cx" - <b>Brogan</b></quote>
