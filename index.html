        <h2>Welcome to my website!</h2>
        <p>This is my new website, thanks to <a id="external" href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>. This website was coded by me, GlitchedCode, and I am very happy with how it looks, even though it's pretty basic. Other pages are still in development, however they can still be visited. The source code of this website can be found <a id="external" href="https://github.com/glitchedcoder/mygithubpage/tree/gh-pages">here</a>. Includes everything from every HTML page along with CSS.</p>
        <h2>For Gunnar (iGoochy):</h2>
        <p>Some times, things may not go your way, people could be rude, or just things in general can put you down. Here are some things that will cheer you up in these hard times. Below, we answered the question, "What's one thing you like about Gunnar?" Thanks for bee-ing awesome. :bee:</p>
        <quote>"Well, there's so many things, really. He's just such a generous and humorous person, and that's usually why I ask him so many times for him to start a call, because when he's there, I have a good time, no matter what we actually do while calling, whether it's slaying people in SkyWars or on some stupid game on Hypickle. He has a great and welcoming personality, and usually is very fair with new people. He sticks up for people whenever others (most of the time, me) talks about people they don't like. I especially like it when he rages, always cracks me up. In summary, he's a great a loving guy that can always cheer you up, make you laugh, etc." - <b>Justin</b></quote>
        <quote>"I love you for you." - <b>Elly</b></quote>
        <quote>(Gonna start and this sounds cheesy asf lmao) - He's always happy and in the time i've known him he's cheered me up so many times without knowing it xD also the fact that when he's raging it's the funniest thing ever cx - <b>Brogan</b></quote>
        <quote>"He has a personality which is similar to mine and it helped our friendship build exponentially" - <b>Tim</b></quote>
        <quote>"His humor? Like it's stupid but funny; Quality banter" - <b>Ana</b></quote>
        <quote>"He's a great guy that knows when to make jokes but also when to stop, and that's a wonderful quality that exists in so few people. He's a genuinely good person." - <b>Elliot</b></quote>
        <quote>"my overall impression of him is that he is funny and makes everyone else happy when they're feeling down. He's actually made me laugh when I was going through a rough time." - <b>Bandy</b></quote>
        <quote>"he is a nice person and helps everyone" - <b>Branko</b></quote>
