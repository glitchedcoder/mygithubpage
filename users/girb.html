            <quote>"I can honestly say that Girb is the absolute love of my life. He has got to be one of my favourite people in the world. His constant friendship towards me is amazing and I cannot imagine a world without him in my life. The past 3 years of friendship that he has given me has proved that he is a wonderful addition to my life. He also has fluffy hair." - <b>ClojoBlue</b></quote>
            <quote>"We've known eachother for so long now and I am glad we've met. You're one of my favourite people to talk to and you're really funny. I love it whenever you're being so sarcastic. Oh and even if you say that you're an ass sometimes I do not agree with this and you know. You're an amazing person and you are so wise. Please stay awesome." - <b>Little_Tigress</b></quote>
