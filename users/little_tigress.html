            <quote>"I will never find the correct words to describe the friendship and love I have for Tigress. She has a heart of gold and I'm so happy to be able to call her one of my closest friends. She is my shoulder to cry on. She has always stuck by my side, even in the toughest of situations, which further proves her compassion for people." - <b>ClojoBlue</b></quote>
            <quote>"Tigress, I've known you for a few years now and you're amazing. You're smart, you're beautiful, you're on of a kind. You've been there for me when I've needed someone, and you've stuck with me for some damn reason. I wish that you'd accept what an amazing person you are! You really need to. You're a wonderful artist, a great person, and OH LORD THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS I COULD SAY. But my mind isn't in the right place at this time. You know why. But I love you and you're just bsadjkbhsadhba amazing Ily &lt;33333" - <b>BernieDaddy</b></quote>
