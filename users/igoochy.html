            <quote>"Well, there's so many things, really. He's just such a generous and humorous person, and that's usually why I ask him so many times for him to start a call, because when he's there, I have a good time, no matter what we actually do while calling, whether it's slaying people in SkyWars or on some stupid game on Hypickle. He has a great and welcoming personality, and usually is very fair with new people. He sticks up for people whenever others (most of the time, me) talks about people they don't like. I especially like it when he rages, always cracks me up. In summary, he's a great a loving guy that can always cheer you up, make you laugh, etc." - <b>GlitchedCode</b></quote>
