            <quote>"Mel, I can't thank you enough for the things you have done for me, because you are so God-damn great! You've stuck by me through slightly awkward situations where you easily could have dropped away; tried to sort situations out without even bothering to think about the benefits of yourself and valuing the friendships and happiness of others more than your own; and you never fail to make me smile. I sincerely love you from the bottom of my heart, even if you do make the cheesiest of puns and repeat phrases a lot, but that's part of who you are, and I adore it in every way. Thank you for such a great friendship, one that I hope lives on forever." - <b>Onx</b></quote>
            <quote>"Mel was the first person to open up with me about awful things while we were clan leaders together. She's been extremely supportive and nice to me and a few other people lately, even though she just moved and has a lot going on in her real life. One of the most lovely people out there." - <b>wakasocks</b></quote>
