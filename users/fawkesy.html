            <quote>"She goes through so much and still manages to keep on giving back to Hive's community and more. She's an extremely talented skinner, is a great singer(if you've ever heard her sing), has great music tastes, and is impossibly kind. She's there for your ups and she's there for your downs, and is one of the most wonderful people to befriend, and one of the purest at heart that I know." - <b>wakasocks</b></quote>
