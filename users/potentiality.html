            <quote>"Despite only knowing Caitlin for a few months, I already know that she is very trustworthy and down to earth. She never fails to bring happiness to people and I cannot thank her enough for being so sweet and caring towards me. Our shared love for our music tastes and favourite games has brung us closer and I'm very happy to call her a friend." - <b>ClojoBlue</b></quote>
