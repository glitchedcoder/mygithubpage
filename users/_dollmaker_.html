            <quote>"Even though he's really shy, he's really, really kind, and will go completely out of his way to help people. He's often really hard on himself, but is one of the most innocent, the nicest, most sincere, and talented people I've ever had the gift of meeting." - <b>wakasocks</b></quote>
