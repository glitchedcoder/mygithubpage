            <quote>"Incoming Cheesy-Couple Comment": Words cannot describe how amazing of a person Lewis is (I could literally write a novel about how much I love this boy, but it's 1:41am and I am lacking effort). His personality is enough to light up the world and he never fails to make someone laugh or smile, despite how they are feeling that day. He is exceptionally caring and loving towards his close friend group, as well as people in general. He's incredibely intelligent (HE GOT ACCEPTED INTO UNIVERISTY!!!). It is almost impossible to be upset it Lewis' prescence (I'm not biast, I promise). I love him so much, and I'm a very lucky person to have him in my life. Lewis est vraiment mignon, donc j'adore Lewis! <3" - <b>ClojoBlue</b></quote>
