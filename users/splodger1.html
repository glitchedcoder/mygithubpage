            <quote>"Incoming Cheesy-Couple Comment": Words cannot describe how amazing of a person Lewis is (I could literally write a novel about how much I love this boy, but it's 1:41am and I am lacking effort). His personality is enough to light up the world and he never fails to make someone laugh or smile, despite how they are feeling that day. He is exceptionally caring and loving towards his close friend group, as well as people in general. He's incredibely intelligent (HE GOT ACCEPTED INTO UNIVERISTY!!!). It is almost impossible to be upset it Lewis' prescence (I'm not biast, I promise). I love him so much, and I'm a very lucky person to have him in my life. Lewis est vraiment mignon, donc j'adore Lewis!" - <b>ClojoBlue</b></quote>

            <quote>"Even though we've not known eachother for that long I am still really glad that we became friends. You're an amazing person and really sweet. You are really fun to talk to and I feel like I can trust you with a lot of stuff. Stay awesome please." - <b>Little_Tigress</b></quote>
            <quote>"Very funny and very wonderful, Lewis is one of the best people I've had the opportunity to meet thus far on Hive. He spoke to me after I first got mod, and has an electric personality and a great sense of humor, but knows when to be serious and how to handle arguments. The kind of guy that would be fun to start a snow fight with." - <b>wakasocks</b></quote>
            <quote>"Well, I haven't known you for very long, but from what I've heard, and from what I've seen. You're a wonderful person. You're smart, you're British, and you're very, very sweet. You're a fun person to be around, and it's amazing. Have a wonderful day you nerd~" - <b>BernieDaddy</b></quote>
