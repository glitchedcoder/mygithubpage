            <quote>"You're the nicest person I know and you're absolutely beautiful, I love you more than you could imagine" - <b>Splodger1</b></quote>
            <quote>"Chloe is honestly an amazing human being who stands up for what she believes in, and I find that truly inspiring. She is a great listener and shares genuine advice that comes directly from her large heart. Thank you for your wonderful friendship, it is a pleasure to know you." - <b>Forb</b></quote>
            <quote>"Mother" - <b>TysonPhilip</b></quote>
            <quote>"Such a beautiful, friendly, funny person and a delight to be around. Chloe is an amazing friend and person to talk to and I couldn't imagine The Hive without her. No matter what happens to her she continues to remain loyal to the staff team and her friends. Never change Chloe" - <b>SourMatt</b></quote>
            <quote>"We've known eachother for so long now and I am so glad that we met. You are so passionate about everything you do and I look up to you so much you don't even know. You've helped me trough so many rough times and I cannot thank you enough for this. You're an amazing person, are really sweet and got a heart of gold. I can also trust you with everything and it's always fun to talk to you.  I love you so much." - <b>Little_Tigress</b></quote>
            <quote>"One of the sweetest and most sensitive people on Hive, Chloe befriends practically everyone she meets. It's nearly impossible to get on her bad side, and she's great to talk to, great to listen to, and has a wonderful sense of scottish humor. I don't know what I would do without her, or if I would even be a mod if she wasn't here to talk to me. &lt;3 - <b>wakasocks</b></quote>
            <quote>"Chloe, Chloe, Chloe, I have nothing but great things to say about you! You're smart, you're kind,, you're beautiful, you're everything any guy would ever want x3 I know that when I first met you I wasn't the nicest person, I should have just talked to you myself, and went from there. Chloe, you're honestly what ever girl wants to be. Heck, I'm still jealous of you! I mean who wouldn't be. You're such a wonderful person, and I really hope you realize that. You have so many people that love and care about you. BUT NOW WE'RE ENGAGED AND EVERYTHING AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE A CHILD SOON. SO I LOVE YOU, AND YOUR FACE.....Xoxo Gossip Girl" - <b>BernieDaddy</b></quote>
