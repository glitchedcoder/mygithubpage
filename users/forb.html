            <quote>"Forb has the power to be able to light up a room. She has always been very caring towards me and I cannot find the words to be able to say how much I appreciate her friendship. We are also both part of the TOP Clique, so that adds to why I love her so much. <3" - <b>ClojoBlue</b></quote>
