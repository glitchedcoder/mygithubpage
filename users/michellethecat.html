            <quote>"Michelle has a great laugh and is great to have as a spectator as in game for obvious reasons, and for the jokes she makes when you do something like get trapped in a wall, or even just getting to make her laugh. If you have puns and you're in a call with her, everyone is bound to have a good time." - <b>wakasocks</b></quote>
