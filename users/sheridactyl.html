          <quote>"An honestly hilarious friend with an amazing attitude to everything and it's just generally a great person to talk to." - <b>ReadySalted</b></quote>
          <quote>"Sheri, my fianc√©! Awh, you are so funny and that SkyWars game we played together and you fell from a tree and died in was funny as hell. I love playing with you and enjoy your infectious personality, because you never fail to make me smile. We definitely have to play some more, but you know, after I buy a better quality mic, as mine's apparently rubbish. :^( Oh, and please get your cat to shut up with next time." - <b>Onx</b></quote>
          <quote>"Noot noot, noot noot, noot noot and another noot" - <b>Bismark</b></quote>
